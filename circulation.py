        Implement this by deciding whether the model is in a filling, ejecting, or isovolumic phase and using 
        the corresponding dynamic matrix. 
         
        As discussed in class, be careful about starting and ending the ejection phase. One approach is to check 
        whether the flow is >0, and another is to check whether x1>x3, but neither will work. The first won't start 
        propertly because flow isn't actually updated outside the ejection phase. The second won't end properly 
        because blood inertance will keep the blood moving briefly up the pressure gradient at the end of systole. 
        If the ejection phase ends in this time, the flow will remain non-zero until the next ejection phase.
